setting up the push from obsidian to git. 

## thoughts
- does this matter?
  - for me it certianly does. allows me to keep revisions and notes private/secure with backup.
  - maybe use gitbook for employees   


## issues
- employees don't use vim
- employees don't know git
- employees don't yet understand the benefits of vcs.
